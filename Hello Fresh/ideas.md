I've included some step-##.jpg (and a step-callout.png) - try embedding these in the correct places
    Something to to thing about: what is the difference between png and jpg - do you notice? we can talk about differences between these two most-used formats

Try geting some of the background / foreground colors (red, gray, white, etc) the same as the hello-chef-reference.jpg - now that you know how the do do that with css

Instead of using <br/> takes - try using the margin and padding css properties to do accomplish the same thing  
    remember they both have variants, like margin-top, margin-left, etc

I noticed the recipe columns are different widths.  Can you make it so they are consistent?
    hint width, min-width, max-width
The  hello-chef-reference.jpg reference image has links to their instagram and facebook pages.  Can you make those be actual links to the appropriate hello fresh places?

could you make things prettier with border-radius?

Your recipe is missing step numbers, could you add them - as text, not images - but make them look the same (white in red circles) as the reference image?

That step-callout.png I made for you (zip; attached) will make your footnote area look nicer, but oof how to do that text-wrapping around the image?

I'm pretty sure a css of float: left is what's needed - but I could be wrong if it isn't working easily don't spend too much time on it

But you'll probably need some margin or padding to make it look nice.... which do you think... margin or padding? or maybe a -left or -right variant
Try to do as much as you can with css
You remember that list-based-version?  How much of the css class could be re-used to make that version of the recipe look nicer?
Just for fun, look at this, or also look at this 
but, also, lol, just for fun, flex-box and grid might be a bit advanced and we could look at those together, I barely grok that stuff
but, also, I mean, no harm knowing what's out there, and it's a free country, you do you
For future; install git and gitextensions
we can get to usage later, git's like a whole thing, but hopefully installing software is easy?  I really have no idea
